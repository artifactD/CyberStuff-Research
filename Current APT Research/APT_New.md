"While the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on social engineering to gain a foothold in a target organization or compromise an individual’s device, others have refreshed their toolsets and expanded the scope of their activities. Our regular quarterly reviews are designed to highlight the most significant developments among APT groups.

Here are the top trends we’ve seen in Q2 2023:

One of the main highlights of the quarter was the discovery of the long-running Operation Triangulation campaign, including the previously unknown iOS malware platform.

We’ve become accustomed to seeing established threat actors enhancing their toolsets over time. So far, this year has been no different – in particular, this includes Lazarus’s development of its MATA framework, the new delivery methods and programming languages used by BlueNoroff, new infection methods used by ScarCruft and new malware samples from GoldenJackal.

We also saw a campaign from the newly discovered threat actor Mysterious Elephant.

APT campaigns continue to be geographically dispersed. This quarter, we saw actors focusing their attacks on Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and various parts of Asia.

Geopolitics remains a key driver of APT development, and cyber-espionage continues to be a prime goal of APT campaigns."
